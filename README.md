# KanhaSays

KanhaSays is an AI-powered system that helps people stay motivated by providing them with verses from the Bhagavad Gita, a Hindu scripture full of wisdom and guidance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- keras
- flask

## Usage

The website will ask you to enter your query, and then provide you with a relevant verse from the Bhagavad Gita. You can also choose to translate the verse into your preferred language or listen to it. Additionally, you can switch between dark and light themes based on your preference.

## Detailed Explanation

KanhaSays works by making use of a JSON file that contains all of the verses from the Bhagavad Gita. We use natural language processing (NLP) and neural network techniques to train the model on the JSON file. When a user enters a query, the model converts the query into tokens and intents, and then searches the JSON file for the relevant verse. The system provides the user with the verse and also allows them to translate it and listen to it.

## Future Work

In the future, we plan to improve the system by using a semantic approach to better understand the user's intent and provide more accurate verses. We also plan to add a chatbot feature that will remember the user's previous inputs and provide more personalized responses. Additionally, we plan to allow users to create their own accounts and save their favorite verses for easy access.
